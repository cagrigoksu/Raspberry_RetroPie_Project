   abstract = {In recent years, with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, a large amount of data can be captured from sensors for real-time analysis. By monitoring the traffic video data from the IoT, we can detect the anomalies that may occur and evaluate the security. However, the number of traffic anomalies is extremely limited, so there is a severe over-fitting problem when using traditional deep learning methods. In order to solve the problem above, we propose a similarity metric Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on a channel attention model for traffic anomaly detection task. The method mainly includes (1) A Siamese network with a hierarchical attention model by word embedding so that it can selectively measure similarities between anomalies and the templates. (2) A deep transfer learning method can automatically annotate an unlabeled set while fine-tuning the network. (3) A background modeling method combining spatial and temporal information for anomaly extraction. Experiments show that the proposed method is three percentage points higher than deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) and five percentage points higher than AutoEncoder on the accuracy. No more time consumption is needed for the annotation process. The extracted candidates can be classified correctly through the proposed method.},

With the development of smart manufacturing, there is a need for fast and accurate in-situ inspection of welding quality. Therefore, detection models with higher accuracy and lower computational complexity are required for technical support. Based on that, an in-situ weld surface defect recognition method is proposed in this paper based on an improved lightweight MobileNetV2 algorithm. It builds a defect classification model with MobileNetV2 as the backbone of the network, embeds a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to refine the image feature information, and reduces the network width factor to cut down the number of model parameters and computational complexity. The experimental results show that the proposed weld surface defect recognition method has advantages in both recognition accuracy and computational efficiency. In summary, the method in this paper overcomes the limitations of traditional methods and achieves the goal of reducing labor intensity, saving time, and improving accuracy. It meets the actual needs of in-situ weld surface defect recognition for pipelines, pressure vessels, and other industrial complex products.},

However, on image classification problems, its generalization performance is significantly worse than stochastic gradient descent (SGD). By tuning several inner hyperparameters of Adam, it is possible to lift the performance of Adam and close this gap; but this makes the use of Adam computationally expensive. In this paper, we use a new training approach based on layer-wise weight normalization (LAWN) to solidly improve Adam's performance and close the gap with SGD. LAWN also helps reduce the impact of batch size on Adam's performance.

Automatic detection of spot welding based on machine vision provides an effective way for car body welding quality control. Considering the traditional image processing methods are greatly disturbed by the environment and have unsatisfying robustness, a network model for small object detection is proposed to detect the position and quality of the spot welding of the car body. Based on the existing You Only Look Once (YOLOv3) model, the proposed model has three novel improvements. Firstly, the lightweight network MobileNetV3 is introduced to replace the backbone network of YOLOv3 to ensure accuracy and real-time performance. Secondly, to improve the model's ability for small object detection, a new feature pyramid network (FPN) with efﬁcient cross-scale connections is proposed, which allows easy and fast multiscale feature fusion. Finally, considering the shortcomings of intersection and union ratio (IoU) loss, complete IoU (CIoU) loss is used to improve convergence speed and regression accuracy. Moreover, novel data augmentation is used to enrich the dataset during the model training. Quantitative results on the spot welding dataset show that the proposed approach achieves successful results for resistance spot welding vision inspection.},

Most predecessors used traditional computer vision methods applied to detect defects of steel pipe weld seams. However, traditional computer vision methods rely on prior knowledge and can only detect defects with a single feature, so it is difficult to complete the task of multi-defect classification, while deep learning is end-to-end. In this paper, the state-of-the-art single-stage object detection algorithm YOLOv5 is proposed to be applied to the field of steel pipe weld defect detection, and compared with the two-stage representative object detection algorithm Faster R-CNN.

Advances like SPPnet and Fast R-CNN have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image.

Traditional object detection methods are built on handcrafted features and shallow trainable architectures. Their performance easily stagnates by constructing complex ensembles which combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context from object detectors and scene classifiers. With the rapid development in deep learning, more powerful tools, which are able to learn semantic, high-level, deeper features, are introduced to address the problems existing in traditional architectures. These models behave differently in network architecture, training strategy and optimization function, etc. In this paper, we provide a review on deep learning based object detection frameworks. Our review begins with a brief introduction on the history of deep learning and its representative tool, namely Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Then we focus on typical generic object detection architectures along with some modifications and useful tricks to improve detection performance further. As distinct specific detection tasks exhibit different characteristics, we also briefly survey several specific tasks, including salient object detection, face detection and pedestrian detection. Experimental analyses are also provided to compare various methods and draw some meaningful conclusions.

In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30% relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012---achieving a mAP of 53.3%. Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also compare R-CNN to OverFeat, a recently proposed sliding-window detector based on a similar CNN architecture.

Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is far less likely to predict false detections where nothing exists. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms all other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, by a wide margin when generalizing from natural images to artwork on both the Picasso Dataset and the People-Art Dataset.},

   abstract = {Overfitting is a fundamental issue in supervised machine learning which prevents us from perfectly generalizing the models to well fit observed data on training data, as well as unseen data on testing set. Because of the presence of noise, the limited size of training set, and the complexity of classifiers, overfitting happens. This paper is going to talk about overfitting from the perspectives of causes and solutions. To reduce the effects of overfitting, various strategies are proposed to address to these causes: 1) "early-stopping" strategy is introduced to prevent overfitting by stopping training before the performance stops optimize; 2) "network-reduction" strategy is used to exclude the noises in training set; 3) "data-expansion" strategy is proposed for complicated models to fine-tune the hyper-parameters sets with a great amount of data; and 4) "regularization" strategy is proposed to guarantee models performance to a great extent while dealing with real world issues by feature-selection, and by distinguishing more useful and less useful features.},
